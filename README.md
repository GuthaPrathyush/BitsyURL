# BitsyURL

This is a basic url shortener made to understand the concept of url shorteners.

### My gains

- I've always wanted to switch to Typescript from Javascript as ts is more efficient in terms of debugging, hence this is my first project in TS.
- I've used the MVC architecture for backend for code readability.

# Description
Developed BitsyURL, a URL shortening web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and deployed it on Vercel. This project marks my first use of TypeScript for the frontend, built with React, and my first implementation of MVC architecture on the backend. I completed the project within 4 hours, which included learning and applying TypeScript and the MVC pattern to create a fully functional, efficient solution.
